# Image-Classication-with-Amazon-SageMaker-
The Amazon SageMaker image classification algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that supports multi-label classification. It takes an image as input and outputs one or more labels assigned to that image. It uses a convolutional neural network (ResNet) that can be trained from scratch or trained using transfer learning when a large number of training images are not available.
